# EIV IGP

My implementation of the EIV IGP model in numpyro/JAX. Used for calculating bayesian estimates for rates of sea level change. The rates are integrated to produce the sea level curves.

## Features

- 🚀 Enables running MCMC on the GPU
- ⚡ Supports SVI estimates for extremely fast posterior inference
- 🐍 Clean, pythonic interface
- 🧠 Easy to understand codebase (my biased opinion)

## Usage

Run the `example.ipynb` notebook. It has examples of the workflow - data processing, MCMC, and SVI estimates.
