# EIV IGP

My implementation of the EIV IGP model in numpyro/JAX. Used for calculating bayesian estimates for rates of sea level change. The rates are integrated to produce the sea level curves.

## Features

- Enables running MCMC on the GPU
- Supports SVI estimates for extremely fast posterior inference
- Clean, pythonic interface
- Easy to understand codebase (my biased opinion)
